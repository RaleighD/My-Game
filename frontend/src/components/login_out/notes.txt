Auth0 is set up in the index.js. It wraps the entire app.
You can then import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";
and: const { user, isAuthenticated, getAccessTokenSilently } = useAuth0();

You can then access details from user. like user.name, user.email, etc. 
This is different then the user information stored on the db, but can be helpful for tracking who does what
in the app.

Most important would be user.sub, which will give a unique id. That is used to search the db.
